# Runbook

## Overview

NHS Book a virtual visit is a web application that connects patients to their
loved ones via video call. It's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with
a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database.

Current NHS trusts using the service have been set up with a fork of this
repository to enable their own feature development and the ability to receive
updates from Made Tech. This consists of the following dependencies:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - to build and host the application
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) - to run automated tests on a pull request
- [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) - to send text
  messages and emails
- [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/README.md) - to enable video calls (open source solution)
- [Whereby](https://whereby.com/information/product-api/) - to enable video
  calls (paid solution)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) - to log and monitor uncaught errors and
  exceptions

## Purpose

The main purpose of this runbook is to provide documentation for setting up the
application as described in the overview. That being said, it's entirely
possible to replace these services with ones that work best for your trust.
