## Filter metrics

Currently, a trust admin can see high-level metrics about the usage of the service in their trust such as the number of virtual visits, average visit time, etc. This can be seen on their dashboard.

Whilst useful, from user feedback we learnt that being able to filter the metrics using different properties particularly by date would be useful to "track trends from week to week, month to month, etc."

## Edit a trust

We only enable creating a trust as a site admin, they are unable to edit the details of a trust such as the video provider and password.

## View completed virtual visits

We received user feedback that it's hard to differeniate between a visit which has already been completed by another ward staff. This is because on the scheduled list screen there is no indication of when a visit has been completed.

```
As a ward staff,
I want to be able to see that a virtual visit has been completed,
So that I can differentiate between a visit that has already completed and one that hasn't.
```
