## Filter metrics

Currently, a trust admin can see high-level metrics about the usage of the service in their trust such as the number of virtual visits, average visit time, etc. This can be seen on their dashboard.

Whilst useful, from user feedback we learnt that being able to filter the metrics using different properties particularly by date would be useful to "track trends from week to week, month to month, etc."

I want to be able to filter metrics by date,
So that I can track trends in the usage of the service.

## Edit a trust

We only enable creating a trust as a site admin and changing their video
provider. They're unable to edit the details of a trust such as their password.

```
As a site admin,
I want to be able to edit all details of a trust,
So that I can change details such as the password.
