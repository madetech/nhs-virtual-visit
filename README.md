## Technology

The web application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database and hosted on
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

To notify visitors via text message and/or email, it uses [GOV.UK
Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) which is used widely by
central government, local authorities and the NHS.

To enable video call capabilities, a video provider is used. The following
providers are currently supported:

- [Whereby](https://whereby.com/information/product-api/)
- [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/README.md)

For error monitoring and logging, [Sentry](https://sentry.io) is used.
